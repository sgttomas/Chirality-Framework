# Roadmap - Chirality Framework
**Status Last Updated**: August 24, 2025 at 11:19h
**Note**: Always ask user for current date/time when updating status - AI doesn't have real-time access

References to "CF14" are for the Chirality Framework version 14.

## Current Version: CF14.3.0.0

### Next Release: CF14.3.1.0 - Validation & Scaling

## Strategic Architecture Vision: Cell-Based Semantic Memory

### Transformational Concept | ðŸš€ **BREAKTHROUGH**

**Vision**: Transform CF14 from reasoning methodology into semantic memory system where individual cells become ontologically bound, addressable semantic components with LLM-driven intelligent selection.

**Current State**: Manual matrix construction â†’ systematic operations â†’ outputs  
**Chirality-ai-app Implementation (future, separate project)**: Query â†’ semantic similarity search â†’ intelligent cell selection â†’ context-aware CF14 operations

### Key Components

#### Semantic Cell Database
```
Cell Structure:
- Address: cf14:domain:matrix:row:col:hash
- Content: "Essential Values" 
- Embeddings: Vector representation for similarity search
- Metadata: {
    domain: str,
    validation_score: float,
    usage_count: int,
    provenance: List[Operation],
    quality_metrics: Dict
  }
```

### Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Cell Database Infrastructure 
- [ ] Design cell addressing schema (cf14:domain:matrix:position:hash)
- [ ] Implement cell storage with embeddings in Neo4j
- [ ] Create cell indexing and retrieval system
- [ ] Build semantic similarity search capabilities

#### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Multi-tenant support
- [ ] Audit logging and compliance
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery

#### User Experience
- [ ] Web-based matrix editor
- [ ] Guided semantic valley workflows
- [ ] Template library for common problems
- [ ] Visual reasoning trace explorer

#### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Automated semantic operation validation
- [ ] Regression testing suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit and hardening
