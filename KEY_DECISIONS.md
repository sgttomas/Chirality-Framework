## Decision Entry: Neo4j for Graph Persistence
**Date**: August 17, 2025

### Necessity vs Contingency
**Necessary**: Graph database for semantic relationship tracking and lineage
**Contingent**: Neo4j specifically - could have chosen other graph databases

### Sufficiency
Neo4j handles matrix storage, relationships, and lineage tracking adequately

### Completeness
Full lineage tracking, relationship modeling, data persistence

### Inconsistencies and Consistencies
Graph model aligns with semantic relationship nature

## Decision Entry: Multi-Repository Architecture
**Date**: August 17, 2025

### Necessity vs Contingency
Separation of concerns between framework, interfaces, and orchestration

### Sufficiency
**Sufficient**: Three-repo structure handles current development and deployment needs
**Assessment**: Framework, chat interface, and orchestration work independently

### Completeness
**Complete elements**: Full separation of backend, frontend, and orchestration concerns
**Incomplete elements**: Shared libraries, common utilities, unified testing
**Missing**: Standardized APIs between repositories

### Inconsistencies and Consistencies
Repository boundaries align with functional responsibilities
