  "Mathematically-Grounded Structured Reasoning Pipeline with Multi-Modal Evidence Integration"

  ---
  üî¨ Core Fusion Components:

  1. Matrix-Template Synthesis
  - CF14 semantic matrices (A, B, C, D, F, J) storing ReasonFlux reasoning templates
  - Each matrix cell contains structured reasoning patterns from template library
  - 4 Documents populate matrix axes as evidence domains

  2. Categorical Reasoning Operations
  - Semantic multiplication: Template intersection with evidence domains
  - Trajectory-aware processing: CF14 stations map to ReasonFlux reasoning rounds
  - Process reward modeling: PRM scores guide CF14 operation selection

  3. Multi-Station Reasoning Pipeline
  - S1: Problem formulation using 4 Documents as axioms (A) and reasoning templates as basis (B)
  - S2: Requirements synthesis via semantic multiplication of evidence √ó templates
  - S3: Solution generation through trajectory-aware interpretation
