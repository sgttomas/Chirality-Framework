# GraphQL Neo4j Integration Plan - MOVED

**This document has been consolidated into [API.md](API.md) and [NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md](NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md).**

GraphQL and Neo4j integration details are now documented in:
- [API.md#graph-api-v1](API.md#graph-api-v1) - GraphQL schema, endpoints, and security
- [API.md#configuration](API.md#configuration) - Complete environment variable reference
- [NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md](NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md) - Component selection algorithm and Neo4j model

This stub file will be removed in a future release.
