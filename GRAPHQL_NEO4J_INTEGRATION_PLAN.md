# GraphQL/Neo4j Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to reintegrate the GraphQL service and Neo4j components from the archived backup with the newly created semantic component tracking system. The goal is to create a unified architecture that combines the cell-based semantic memory vision with real-time GraphQL operations and persistent Neo4j storage.

## Current State Analysis

### Archived Components
- **GraphQL Service**: Full-featured service at `/Users/ryan/Desktop/ai-env/chirality-full-backup-20250816/graphql-service/`
  - Production-ready TypeScript implementation with Neo4j integration
  - Complete schema with Component/Cell types and CF14 operations
  - V1 compatibility layer for CLI integration
  - Health checks, logging, authentication, and rate limiting

- **GraphQL Schema**: Comprehensive schema at `/Users/ryan/Desktop/ai-env/chirality-full-backup-20250816/graphql/schema.graphql`
  - Normalized Cell nodes with semantic integrity fields
  - Component types with station pipeline support
  - Derivation relationships and document containment
  - Operation types for auditability

### Current Framework
- **Neo4j Adapter**: Active adapter at `chirality/adapters/neo4j_adapter.py`
  - Basic matrix/cell persistence
  - Thread management and lineage tracking
  - Schema constraints and indexing

- **Semantic Component Tracker**: New tracking system with state evolution
  - Component states: INITIAL → INTERPRETED → COMBINED → RESOLVED
  - Complete operation audit trails
  - Component viewer for transformation exploration

## Integration Architecture

### Phase 1: Service Layer Integration

#### 1.1 GraphQL Service Migration
**Objective**: Bring the archived GraphQL service into the current framework

**Tasks**:
- Copy `graphql-service/` directory to current framework root
- Update package.json dependencies to latest versions
- Verify Neo4j connection compatibility with current adapter
- Test basic service startup and schema generation

**Files to Migrate**:
- `graphql-service/src/index.ts` → GraphQL server implementation
- `graphql-service/package.json` → Service dependencies  
- `graphql-service/schema.graphql` → Complete schema definition

#### 1.2 Schema Enhancement for Component Tracking
**Objective**: Extend GraphQL schema to support semantic component state evolution

**New Schema Elements**:
```graphql
enum ComponentState {
  INITIAL
  INTERPRETED  
  COMBINED
  RESOLVED
}

type ComponentStateHistory {
  state: ComponentState!
  content: String!
  operation: JSON
  timestamp: DateTime!
}

extend type Component {
  stateHistory: [ComponentStateHistory!]!
  currentState: ComponentState!
  semanticContext: JSON!
  dependencies: [Component!]!
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Model Integration

#### 2.1 Neo4j Schema Enhancement
**Objective**: Extend Neo4j schema to support component state evolution

**New Node Types**:
- `ComponentState`: Individual state snapshots with content and metadata
- `SemanticOperation`: Operation records with input/output component references
- `ComponentThread`: Thread-level grouping for semantic operation sequences

**New Relationships**:
- `(:Component)-[:HAS_STATE]->(:ComponentState)`: State evolution tracking
- `(:SemanticOperation)-[:TRANSFORMS]->(:Component)`: Operation lineage
- `(:ComponentThread)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Component)`: Thread membership

#### 2.2 Data Migration Strategy
**Objective**: Migrate existing semantic component data to enhanced schema

**Migration Steps**:
1. Export current `semantic_components.json` data
2. Transform to new Component/Cell schema format
3. Import via GraphQL mutations with state history
4. Validate data integrity and operation lineage

### Phase 3: API Integration

#### 3.1 Enhanced Resolvers
**Objective**: Add resolvers for semantic component state exploration

**New Query Resolvers**:
```typescript
// Component state evolution queries
componentStateHistory(componentId: ID!): [ComponentStateHistory!]!
componentsByState(state: ComponentState!): [Component!]!
operationTrace(componentId: ID!): [SemanticOperation!]!

// Thread-level semantic operations  
semanticThread(threadId: ID!): ComponentThread
threadOperations(threadId: ID!): [SemanticOperation!]!
```

**New Mutation Resolvers**:
```typescript
// Semantic operations with state tracking
performSemanticMultiplication(
  matrixA: ID!, 
  matrixB: ID!, 
  options: SemanticOperationOptions
): SemanticOperationResult!

// Component state transitions
updateComponentState(
  componentId: ID!, 
  newState: ComponentState!, 
  content: String!, 
  operation: JSON
): Component!
```

#### 3.2 Component Viewer API Integration
**Objective**: Connect component viewer with GraphQL backend

**Integration Points**:
- Replace file-based component loading with GraphQL queries
- Add real-time state change subscriptions
- Implement GraphQL-based component filtering and search
- Connect semantic operations to live database updates

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### 4.1 Cell-Based Semantic Memory
**Objective**: Implement ontologically bound cells with addressable semantic meaning

**Cell Addressing Scheme**:
```
cf14:domain:matrix:row:col:hash
cf14:software_dev:A:0:0:a1b2c3  # Quality cell
cf14:software_dev:C:0:0:d4e5f6  # Quality*Critical cell  
```

**Implementation**:
- Extend Cell type with semantic addressing
- Add cell-to-cell semantic relationship tracking
- Implement LLM-based semantic triage for cell selection
- Create semantic interpolation audit trails

#### 4.2 Real-Time Operation Monitoring
**Objective**: Live tracking of semantic operations across the framework

**Features**:
- WebSocket subscriptions for operation events
- Real-time component state visualization
- Operation performance metrics and timing
- Error tracking and recovery mechanisms

#### 4.3 GraphQL Code Generation
**Objective**: Type-safe client integration with the semantic component system

**Generated Artifacts**:
- TypeScript types for all schema elements
- React hooks for component operations
- Python client for CLI integration
- API documentation with operation examples

## Success Criteria

### Technical Milestones
1. **Service Integration**: GraphQL service runs with enhanced schema
2. **Data Persistence**: Component states persist correctly in Neo4j
3. **API Functionality**: All semantic operations work via GraphQL
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Component viewer reflects live database changes
5. **Performance**: Operations complete within acceptable time limits

### Functional Validation
1. **Component Evolution**: Can track complete component transformation journey
2. **Operation Auditability**: Full semantic operation history is queryable
3. **Cell Addressing**: Individual cells have unique, addressable identities
4. **Thread Coherence**: Thread-level operations maintain semantic consistency
5. **LLM Integration**: Semantic interpolation connects seamlessly with persistence

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Schema Migration Complexity**: Use incremental migration with rollback capability
- **Performance Impact**: Implement query optimization and connection pooling
- **Data Consistency**: Add transaction boundaries around multi-step operations
- **Version Compatibility**: Pin dependency versions and test thoroughly

### Integration Risks  
- **Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI tools
- **Service Dependencies**: Implement graceful degradation if Neo4j unavailable
- **Client Integration**: Provide clear migration path for existing component viewer
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for all new functionality

## Future Enhancements
