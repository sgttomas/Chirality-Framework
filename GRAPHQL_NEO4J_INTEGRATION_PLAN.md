# Backend Data Production Plan for Neo4j

## Overview

This document outlines how the chirality-semantic-framework produces and sends semantic component data to Neo4j for consumption by frontend applications. The framework is responsible for executing CF14 semantic operations, tracking component state evolution, and persisting all semantic transformations with complete audit trails.

## What This Backend Produces

### Core Data Products

#### 1. Semantic Components
The framework generates semantic components with complete lifecycle tracking:
- **Initial State**: Raw component content from matrix operations
- **Interpreted State**: After semantic multiplication/interpolation
- **Combined State**: After element-wise combinations
- **Resolved State**: Final semantic resolution

#### 2. Operation Audit Trails
Every semantic operation produces detailed audit records:
- Operation type (multiplication, addition, truncation, etc.)
- Input component references
- Output component creation
- Resolver used (OpenAI, Claude, demo)
- Performance metrics (duration, tokens, API calls)
- Complete timestamp trail

#### 3. Cell-Based Semantic Addresses
Each cell receives a unique ontological address:
```
cf14:domain:matrix:row:col:hash
Example: cf14:software_dev:A:0:0:a1b2c3
```

## Data Production Pipeline

### Task 1: Component State Production

**Objective**: Generate and track semantic components through their complete lifecycle

**Production Tasks**:
- Create initial components from matrix definitions
- Execute semantic multiplication operations
- Track state transitions (INITIAL → INTERPRETED → COMBINED → RESOLVED)
- Generate unique component IDs with thread context
- Compute semantic hashes for deduplication

**Data Sent to Neo4j**:
```python
{
    "id": "thread_id:matrix:row:col",
    "matrix_name": "A|B|C|D|F|J",
    "matrix_position": [row, col],
    "thread_id": "semantic_thread_identifier",
    "initial_content": "raw_cell_value",
    "current_state": "resolved",
    "states": {
        "initial": "content",
        "interpreted": "semantic_result",
        "combined": "combined_result",
        "resolved": "final_result"
    },
    "semantic_context": {...},
    "timestamps": {...}
}
```

### Task 2: Operation Lineage Production

**Objective**: Create complete operation lineage for every semantic transformation

**Production Tasks**:

- Establish dependency relationships

**Data Sent to Neo4j**:
```python
{
    "operation_id": "uuid",
    "operation_type": "semantic_multiplication",
    "input_components": ["comp_id_1", "comp_id_2"],
    "output_component": "result_comp_id",

        # Trigger Neo4j persistence
        self.neo4j.update_component_state(...)
    
    def on_operation_complete(operation):
        # Persist operation lineage
        self.neo4j.save_operation_lineage(...)
```

### Task 6: Semantic Operation Producers

**Objective**: Implement producers for each semantic operation type

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Create producer for semantic multiplication
- Create producer for element-wise combination
- Create producer for semantic addition
- Create producer for truncation operations
- Create producer for final synthesis

**Producer Pattern**:
```python
class SemanticMultiplicationProducer:
    def produce(self, matrix_a, matrix_b):
        # Execute semantic operation
        result = self.llm_resolver.multiply(matrix_a, matrix_b)
        
        # Create component records
        components = self.create_components(result)
        
        # Generate operation audit
        operation = self.create_operation_audit(...)
        
        # Send to Neo4j
        self.neo4j.save_batch(components, operation)
        
        return components
```

## Data Quality Assurance

        # Write to local cache
        self.cache.store(data)
        
        # Add to retry queue
        self.retry_queue.add(data)
        
        # Alert if threshold exceeded
        if self.failure_count > THRESHOLD:
            self.alert("Neo4j persistence failing")
```

## Data Contract with Frontend

### What This Backend Guarantees

1. **Component Completeness**: Every component has full state history
2. **Operation Traceability**: Complete audit trail for all operations
3. **Semantic Addressing**: Unique, addressable cells via cf14 scheme
4. **Consistency**: ACID compliance for related operations
5. **Performance**: Batch operations complete within 5 seconds
6. **Availability**: Local caching ensures continued operation during Neo4j downtime

### Data Available for Frontend Consumption

The backend produces and maintains these data types in Neo4j:
- Semantic Components with state evolution
- Operation audit trails with lineage
- Thread-level semantic contexts

- Semantic cell addressing mappings

Frontend applications can query this data via GraphQL without understanding the production complexity.

## Testing Strategy

### Task 11: Production Testing

**Objective**: Ensure reliable data production

**Test Scenarios**:
- Component lifecycle from creation to resolution
- Batch operation performance under load
- Neo4j failure recovery procedures
- Data consistency validation
- Semantic addressing uniqueness
- Thread isolation and ordering

**Test Implementation**:
```python
class TestDataProduction:
    def test_component_lifecycle(self):
        # Create, transform, persist, verify
        
    def test_batch_performance(self):
        # Generate 1000 components, measure throughput
        
    def test_neo4j_recovery(self):
        # Simulate failure, verify recovery
```

This backend-focused plan ensures the chirality-semantic-framework produces high-quality, traceable semantic component data for Neo4j consumption by frontend applications.
