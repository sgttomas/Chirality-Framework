# Integration Architecture - MOVED

**This document has been consolidated into [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).**

Integration flows and system architecture are now documented in:
- [ARCHITECTURE.md#two-pass-generation-architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#two-pass-generation-architecture) - Core generation methodology  
- [ARCHITECTURE.md#core-principle-files-as-source-of-truth](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-principle-files-as-source-of-truth) - Files vs graph mirror design
- [API.md](API.md) - API endpoints and integration examples

This stub file will be removed in a future release.
