References to "CF14" are for the Chirality Framework version 14.

## System Overview

The Chirality Semantic Framework generates the semantic contents of components in the Chirality Framework.  It performs element-wise operations according to the definitions of semantic operations and then stores them in a graph database (Neo4j implementation).  The framework is then integrated with a front end (a separate project called "chirality-app") but none of that is present in this project.  It's a truly distinct backend / frontend configuration where neither directly interact with each other but instead both interact with the database.

## High-Level Architecture

```
Basic operations (*, +, âŠ™, Ã—, interpret) cover core semantic transformations

```

## Two-Pass Generation Architecture

The Chirality Framework implements a novel two-pass document generation methodology that ensures cross-referential coherence and comprehensive problem coverage.

## SEMANTIC_OPERATIONS_QUICK_REF
- **op_multiply(A, B)**: Semantic intersection A * B â†’ C (requirements from axioms)
- **op_interpret(C)**: Stakeholder translation C â†’ J (clarify requirements)  
- **op_elementwise(J, C)**: Element combination J âŠ™ C â†’ F (merge interpretation)
- **op_add(A, F)**: Semantic concatenation A + F â†’ D (final objectives)
- **Stations**: S1(validate) â†’ S2(multiply) â†’ S3(interpret+elementwise+add)

## RESOLVER_STRATEGIES
- **OpenAIResolver**: LLM semantic interpolation (production)
- **EchoResolver**: Deterministic testing (development)
- **Interface**: resolve(operation, inputs, prompts, context) â†’ matrix_content

## MATRIX_TYPES
- **A**: Problem axioms (normative/operative/evaluative Ã— guiding/applying/judging/reflecting)
- **B**: Decision basis (data/info/knowledge/wisdom Ã— determinacy/sufficiency/completeness/consistency)
- **C**: Requirements (A * B semantic intersection)
- **J**: Interpretation (stakeholder-friendly C)
- **F**: Functions (J âŠ™ C element-wise combination)
- **D**: Objectives (A + F final synthesis)

## KEY_PATTERNS
- Content-based hashing for deterministic IDs
- Matrix dimensional validation before operations
- Complete operation provenance tracking in Neo4j
- Human-in-the-loop validation at each station
- Pluggable resolver strategy pattern
- Structured prompt engineering for LLM semantic interpolation

## Troubleshooting Architecture Issues

### Common Implementation Problems

#### Matrix Dimension Mismatches

**Solution**: Verify matrix shapes match CF14 specification in [`cf14_spec.json`](chirality/cf14_spec.json)

#### Resolver Connection Failures  
**Symptom**: ResolverError or timeout during operations
**Cause**: OpenAI API key issues or network connectivity
**Solution**: Check environment variables in [`.env.example`](.env.example), validate API key

#### Neo4j Persistence Issues
**Symptom**: Database connection errors during `--write-neo4j`
**Cause**: Neo4j service not running or incorrect credentials
**Solution**: Verify Neo4j service status, check connection string in environment

#### Station Pipeline Failures
**Symptom**: Incomplete semantic valley execution
**Cause**: Missing dependencies between processing stations
**Solution**: Review [`stations.py`](chirality/core/stations.py:1-150) for proper input validation

### Performance Considerations

#### Large Matrix Processing
- **Current Limit**: 10x10 matrices tested effectively
- **Memory Usage**: ~1MB per matrix with full provenance
- **Optimization**: Use streaming processing for larger datasets

#### LLM Resolution Latency
- **OpenAI API**: 2-5 seconds per semantic operation
- **Batching**: Multiple operations in single request reduces overhead
- **Caching**: Content-based hashing prevents duplicate operations
