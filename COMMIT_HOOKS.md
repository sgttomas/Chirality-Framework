# Git Commit Hooks for CF (Chirality Framework) Documentation Review Cycle

*Systematic integration of documentation improvements with git workflow*
**Status Last Updated**: August 24, 2025 at 11:19h
**Note**: Always ask user for current date/time when updating status - AI doesn't have real-time access
References to "CF14" are for the Chirality Framework version 14.

## Purpose

This document establishes the trigger mechanism for CF (Chirality Framework) documentation review cycles through git commit workflow integration. It ensures that significant changes automatically initiate systematic documentation updates following CF (Chirality Framework) methodology.

## Commit Trigger Classification

### Documentation Review Triggers

**Major Documentation Overhaul Required:**
- Feature additions affecting user-facing APIs
- Architectural changes impacting system design
- New capability implementations
- Research findings requiring claim updates
- User feedback indicating systematic documentation issues

**Standard Documentation Updates:**
- Bug fixes with user impact
- Configuration changes
- Minor feature enhancements
- Routine maintenance updates

**No Documentation Review:**
- Internal refactoring without external impact
- Test-only changes
- Development environment updates

## Pre-Commit Documentation Assessment

### Commit Message Analysis Framework

When preparing commits that may trigger documentation review, include this analysis in the commit message:

```
[STANDARD COMMIT MESSAGE]

--- CHIRALITY FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT ---
Trigger Level: [MAJOR_OVERHAUL | STANDARD_UPDATE | NO_REVIEW]
Affected Documentation Categories:
- [ ] Primary User Documents (README, API, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- [ ] Technical Reference (ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING)  
- [ ] Assessment Documents (SPECULATIVE_CLAIMS)
- [ ] Project Management (STATUS, ROADMAP, DECISIONS)

Impact Analysis:
- User Experience Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NONE]
- Technical Accuracy Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NONE]
- Capability Claims Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NONE]

Methodology Recommendation: [4_DOCUMENTS | USER_JOURNEY | EVIDENCE_UPDATE | CONSISTENCY_AUDIT]

Estimated Documentation Scope: [1-3 documents | 4-6 documents | 7+ documents | Full suite]
```

## Documentation Review Cycle Trigger Process

### Step 1: Commit Message Analysis
```bash
# Extract documentation assessment from commit message
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%B" | grep -A 20 "CF14 DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT"
```

### Step 2: Execute Documentation Review Cycle
Follow the generated CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN:
- Update affected documents systematically
- Track status through KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md
- Maintain complete reasoning trace
- Validate improvements against success criteria

### Step 4: Commit Message Revision
After documentation review cycle completion, create amended commit with updated message:

```
[ORIGINAL COMMIT MESSAGE]

--- CHIRALITY FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTATION REVIEW COMPLETED ---
Review Cycle: [Date] - [CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN reference]
Documents Updated: [List of files with status changes]
Methodology Applied: [4_DOCUMENTS | USER_JOURNEY | etc.]
Phases Completed: [List of completed phases]
Validation Results: [Success criteria met]

Documentation Status Post-Review:
âœ… UPDATED: [List of newly updated documents]
âœ… CURRENT: [List of validated current documents]  
ðŸ“‹ PLANNED: [List of future improvements identified]

Reasoning Trace: [Reference to complete audit trail]
Next Review Trigger: [Conditions for next documentation cycle]
```


## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Create Git Hook Templates**: Develop actual hook scripts for automation
2. **Document Integration**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md with commit message requirements
3. **Tool Development**: Build automation for assessment analysis and plan generation
4. **Team Training**: Establish understanding of documentation review cycle integration

**This systematic approach ensures that documentation quality evolves continuously with the codebase, using CF's own methodology to maintain systematic improvement through each development cycle.**
